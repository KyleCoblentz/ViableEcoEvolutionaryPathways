This folder contains the code required to do the analyses to produce 1) the landscape of population persistance, 
2) the landscape of minimum population size values, 3) the landscape of maximum eigenvalues, and 4) the landscape
of qualitative stability outcomes that are given in Figures 2 and 3.

The repository contains the following code and data generated with it:

BDLogistic_LinearStabilityAnalysis.nb -- a Mathematica notebook that performs linear stability analysis for the landscape

Call_MR_bdLogistic_Landscape.m -- Matlab file that performs the analysis of getting population persistance for each point 
on the space clearance rate-handling time plane. This file requires the following other matlab files within the repository:
GEM_MR_bdLogistic.m, MacArthurRosenzweig_bdLogistic.m, rep.m, V4_medians_and_cis.m, V4_pick_individuals

Pop_Persist_Plot.R -- R code for plotting the landscapes in Figures 2 and 3. Uses the data found in ProportionExt_HighIntComp.csv,
and Stability_ahPlane.csv for Figure 2 and ProportionExt_LowIntComp.csv and Stability_ahPlane_HighK.csv for Figure 3.
