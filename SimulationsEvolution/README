This folder contains Matlab code to perform the analyses with predator evolution in the space clearance rate-handling 
time plane to illustrate viable eco-evolutionary pathways.

The folder contains the following files:

Call_MR_bdLogistic_EvolonLandscape -- this file contains the code that performs the Gillespie Eco-evolutionary Model (GEM) 
simulations to examine the evolutionary trajectories of predators on the space clearance rate-handling time plane

GEM_MR_bdLogistic -- this file defines the function for the GEM of the 
MacArthur-Rosenzweig model to run

MacArthurRosenzweig_bdLogistic -- this file defines a function for the deterministic ODE of the 
MarArthur-Rosenzweig model

rep -- this file contains a user-defined that replicates R's version of the function rep

V4_medians_and_cis -- this file is called by the GEM file to calculate median values across time steps 
and to get confidence intervals

V4_pick_individuals -- this function is called by the GEM file to pick the initial individuals for 
the GEM simulations
