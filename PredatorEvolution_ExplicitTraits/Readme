This folder contains the code required to do the analyses to perform stochastic eco-evolutionary simulations of predator 
evolution and compare the trajectories of extinct and extant populations with explicit traits determining predator 
space clearance rates and handling times.

The repository contains the following code and data generated with it:

Call_MR_bdLogistic_Evolution_ExplicitTraits_mod.m -- Matlab file that performs the analysis of the eco-evolutionary model. 
This file requires the following other matlab files within the repository:
GEM_MR_bdLogistic_ExplicitTraits_mod.m, MacArthurRosenzweig_bdLogistic_ExplicitTraits_mod.m, rep.m, V4_medians_and_cis.m, V4_pick_individuals.m, jbfill.m

Figure4_Equiv_Plot_mod.R -- R code for creating the plots in Supplemental Material S3. Uses the data found in ProportionExt_LowIntComp.csv,
indrundata.csv, mediantraitdata.csv, popmediandata.csv, TraitDynamicsQG.csv.
