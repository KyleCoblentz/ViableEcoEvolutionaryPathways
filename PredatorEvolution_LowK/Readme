This folder contains the code required to do the analyses to perform stochastic eco-evolutionary simulations of predator 
evolution and compare the trajectories of extinct and extant populations.

The repository contains the following code and data generated with it:

BDLogistic_FeasibilityandStabilityBoundaries_NumericEvol.nb -- a Mathematica notebook that gives numeric results from a 
quantitative genetics version of the eco-evolutionary model

Call_MR_bdLogistic_EvolonLandscape.m -- Matlab file that performs the analysis of the eco-evolutionary model. 
This file requires the following other matlab files within the repository:
GEM_MR_bdLogistic.m, MacArthurRosenzweig_bdLogistic.m, rep.m, V4_medians_and_cis.m, V4_pick_individuals.m, jbfill.m

Figure4_Plot.R -- R code for creating the plots in Figure 4. Uses the data found in ProportionExt_HighIntComp.csv,
indrundata.csv, mediantraitdata.csv, popmediandata.csv, TraitDynamicsQG.csv.
