# ViableEcoEvolutionaryPathways
Code for Coblentz and DeLong 'Ecological boundaries and constraints on viable eco-evolutionary pathways'

This repository contains four folders: 1) No Evolution, 2) PredatorEvolution_LowK, 3) PredatorEvolution_HighK, and 
4) PredatorEvolution_ExplicitTraits

No Evolution contains the code for determining which areas of the space clearance rate-handling time plane lead to likely
extinction when demographic stochasticity occurs in the model but all individuals are identical and there is no evolution. It also
includes code for performing the linear stability analysis. 

PredatorEvolution_LowK contains the code in which the predator population evolves and illustrates differences in eco-evolutionary 
trajectories between extinct and extant populations following the simulation and when the prey has a low carrying capacity

PredatorEvolution_HighK contains the code in which the predator population evolves and illustrates differences in eco-evolutionary 
trajectories between extinct and extant populations following the simulation and when the prey has a high carrying capacity

PredatorEvolution_ExplicitTraits contains the code for the analysis of the model in the Supplemental Information in which the predator
has explicit traits that determine its space clearance rates and handling times and these parameters have a maximum and minimum, respectively
