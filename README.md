# ViableEcoEvolutionaryPathways
Code for Coblentz and DeLong 'Ecological boundaries and constraints on viable eco-evolutionary pathways'

This repository contains two folders: 1) SimulationsNoEvolution and 2) SimulationsEvolution

SimulationsNoEvolution contains the code for determining which areas of the space clearance rate-handling time plane lead to likely
extinction when demographic stochasticity occurs in the model but all individuals are identical and there is no evolution. It also
includes code for performing the linear stability analysis. 

SimulationsEvolution contains the code in which the predator population evolves and illustrates differences in eco-evolutionary 
trajectories between extinct and extant populations following the simulation
